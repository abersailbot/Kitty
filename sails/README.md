sails
=====

Kitty's sails, made using [Sailcut](http://www.sailcut.com/). Currently two sails planned:

  * `heavy_air.saildef` - for heavy winds
  * `light_air.saildef` - for light winds

The sails wrap around the mast, so add an extra 83mm (circumference of the mast)
+ 40mm (leech hem) from the mast edge of the sail.

Output formats for printing are stored in [output](output).
